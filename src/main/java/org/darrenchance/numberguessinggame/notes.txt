New ideas

Add a form called set up
- This could allow for different game modes
    for example,
    - 2 player head to head
    - Playing to a specific score
    - Customizing number ranges

Idea
- What if a player gets it correct on the first guess?
  They should get a bonus point, similar to bowling
  maybe?

The form should include things such as
- Player1 name, player2 name
- Radio buttons that can dynamically change the form
- Radio buttons could represent the game modes


Last but not least, the page will need some type of style.

I need to post this to Git
